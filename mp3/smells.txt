Question 1:
This code smell is an example of duplicated code. To remove the duplicated code,
I created a new method that can be call from both places the code used to exist.
By extracting the method, it allows for programmers to understand the code better 
and it also allows the program to be modified more easily in the future.

Question 2:
No question.

Question 3:
This code smell is also an example of duplicated code, however in this case the 
code was in different classes. To remove the code smell I created a new method 
and then placed that method in the jenkins.model.Jenkins' class. This method
makes more sense in its new location because it is using methods from the
jenkins.model.Jenkins' class.

Question 4:
To get rid of this repeated code I created a for loop with the repeated code inside.
The statement loops through 4 times since that was the number of times the code was 
repeated. 

Question 6:
I would eliminate the duplicate code in RunParameterDefinitionTest.java. There is about
20 lines of code that are repeated in 5 different test cases. I would use the Extract 
method, and put the repeated lines of code in the new method and then call it from
each place the code is repeated.
